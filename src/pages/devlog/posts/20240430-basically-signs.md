Well, we know Minecraft's vanilla signs are classic yet only having as many signs as wood types with no colors, is a bit boring, that's why we made Basically Signs which is a mod that adds signs, a lot of signs.

Basically signs add over 40 (41 as of March 30th, 2024), to Minecraft, all of them unique for you to have a variety of signs to choose from. It currently adds 4 different patterns with at least 4 different colors textures each, plus a lot of miscellaneous signs.

Since we wanted to make as many signs as possible without having to think about all the different recipes on the crafting table, we made the *sign workbench* where you can get the different signs of our mod by adding a dye to a vanilla Minecraft sign.

We know that someone might want to add their custom recipes for the sign workbench as well, so we added [a custom recipe type](nerdblog.md) which will help you add new recipes to the workbench even without them having to be signs related.

We also made the tedious work of adding a custom sign on Minecraft simpler, so with the Basically Signs API it would take just a few lines of code and a couple data files for other people to add their custom (and Basically Signs compatible) signs on Minecraft.

If you're more interested in the development of Basically Signs programming-wise make sure to check out TomTobby's [nerd post](nerdblog.md), if you're a bit more interested design-wise you can take a look to scarletsparks' [art log](artlog.md)
